-- 1. Safely drop existing policies if they exist (to avoid conflicts)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own projects" ON public.projects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create their own projects" ON public.projects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own projects" ON public.projects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own projects" ON public.projects;

-- 2. Create the proper RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own projects" 
ON public.projects FOR SELECT 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can create their own projects" 
ON public.projects FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own projects" 
ON public.projects FOR UPDATE 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own projects" 
ON public.projects FOR DELETE 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
